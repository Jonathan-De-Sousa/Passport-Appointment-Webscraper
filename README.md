# Passport-Appointment-Webscraper
Python Selenium webscraper to find available passport appointments.

Main script [AgendamentosOnline_Webscraper.py] looks for vacant passport booking 
and sends SMS to phone if vacancy exists.

The webscraping capabilities are implemented using the Selenium library and the 
SMS capibilities are implemented using the Twilio API.
